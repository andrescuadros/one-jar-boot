### Setup

In order to install your one-jar-boot.jar artifact in your local repository you can execute installArtifact.sh if you are on linux or installArtifact.bat if you are on Windows.

The scripts use maven to put the one-jar-boot<version>.jar in your local maven repository. If you prefer install manually take a look to http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-3rd-party-jars-local.html
